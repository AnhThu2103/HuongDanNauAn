(extra for pizza too)In a food processor we're going to put our basil, the cheese, soaked almonds, little salt and pepper, and 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil.Process it on and off for thirty seconds.Then drizzle in the rest of the olive oil while the food processor is on. This makes sure you get the optimal consistency for your likings.When it's made fresh the oil tends to separate from the other ingredients. I suggest serving this after it's been in the refrigerator for an hour because the pesto rests and stays together better.When the dough has doubled plop it onto a lightly dusted countertop and move it around so the entire dough gets covered.Divide it into thirds.Preheat the oven to 500F and place a baking stone on the middle rack. (you can also use an overturned cookie sheet)NOTE: The baking stone/cookie sheet has to be larger than the size of the pizza you are making, otherwise it will hang over the edges and burn onto the oven rack.Coat one ball of dough with flour and place it on a well-floured surface. Using your fingertips, gently flatten the dough into an 8-inch disk, leaving an inch or so of outer edge thicker than the center.Using your hands, gently stretch it into a 10-12 inch round, working along the edges and giving the dough quarter turns as you stretch it."
